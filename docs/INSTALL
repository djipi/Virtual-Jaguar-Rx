-------------------------------------------
Virtual Jaguar v2.1.3 Rx Qt release INSTALL
-------------------------------------------


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

The minimum requirements for compiling Virtual Jaguar Rx from source are:

 o  GCC v4.4.x or higher
 o  SDL2-2.30.8
 o  zlib v1.2.8 or higher
 o  libelf 0.8.13
 o  libdwarf 20210528
 o  libcdio v0.90 or higher (optional, for Jaguar CD support)
 o  OpenGL libraries
 o  Qt 5.5.1 or higher
 o  Visual Studio 2017 (if any of interest)
 o  supported OS (WIN64 through msys2/MinGW64, Windows 64 bits, Linux); other
    OSs may work too but you may need to change some items in the Makefile or adapt the Visual Studio project.
 o  cygwin64 support is done but no test has been completed

Previously supported OS (BeOS, FreeBSD and WIN32 through mingw, MacOS);
other OSs may work to but you may need to change some items in the Makefile.


COMPILING:
----------

Assuming that you meet the minimum software requirements, you can compile
the emulator by issuing the following command in the directory where you
decompressed the source:

make

Optionally you can manually strip virtualjaguar[.exe] to downsize the binary.
You can also run upx on the binary as well and you'll end up with a somewhat
smaller binary.

That's it! You can now start the emulator with ./virtualjaguar. See the built
in help (Help|Contents) for more info.

NOTES FOR COMPILING UNDER MAC OSX:
----------------------------------

All is not well in Appleland, but we can help. Apple, in their infinite wisdom,
has decided not to ship a compiler and tools to build software. So first of all
you need to download and install 'Command Line Tools for XCode'. Then, to
compile the bare minimum app under OSX requires libsdl and Qt; however, these
must be made statically and installed "the unix way". What that means is you
have to download and unpack the source directories, then make and install them
from the terminal. For libsdl, this is as simple as doing:

./configure
make
sudo make install

libsdl makes both static *and* shared libs and installs both. Making Qt takes a
bit longer (timewise), but requires not much user intervention to get things
going. Basically, you do:

./configure -static -no-webkit -no-qt3support -no-framework -no-exceptions -nomake examples -nomake demos
make
sudo make install

Be forewarned that it will use around 20 GB of disk space to build, and another
20 GB for the install! Once libsdl and Qt have been made and installed, you can
now go into the folder where the Virtual Jaguar Rx source is and do:

make

Assuming all went well, you should now have a nice shiny new virtualjaguar.app
in that folder. Depending on how old your copy of OSX is, you might have to
copy a qt_menu.nib into the app bundle like so:

cp -r ~/location-where-you-built-qt/src/gui/mac/qt_menu.nib virtualjaguar.app/Contents/Resources/

Have fun!


NOTES FOR COMPILING UNDER VISUAL STUDIO 2017:
---------------------------------------------

Win-VS2017 sub-directory contains the project and solution file.
You may have to adapt such files to handle your own development environement,
usualy to put the right include and library paths will be enough assuming you have all the requirements properly set.

Assuming all went well, you will have either Debug or Release executables.
You will also need the necessary DLLs in the executable directory.
