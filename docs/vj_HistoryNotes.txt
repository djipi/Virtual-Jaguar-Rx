Known issues
============
1) Video output is not displayed due to my OpenGL / Qt5 5.5.1 integration with VS 2015 but solved when using the Qt 5.9.1 package for VS 2017
2) The BPM (Breapoint) remains stuck on his address when user wants to continue the code execution
-- Need to trace over the BPM or unset the BPM
-- The issue can be prevented if the code doesn't set IRQ, otherwise the IRQ will need to be traced to get back control
3) DWARF 2 support
-- With GCC: the code must be compiled with the -gdwarf-2 option
4) The Local and Watch variables window  may display not available type information or empty information
-- Such missing information may be included in future release
-- The 'const' type may not be reported correctly in the DWARF information 
5) The 2MB mirroring is no longer applied in case of --dram-max option usage
6) Stack must reflect the --dram-max option usage otherwise the stack may be corrupted
-- The application needs to set the SP (Stack) in accordance
7) The Exception Vector Table window displays only 65 vectors
-- Missing vectors may be added in future release
8) User needs to manualy check if the Atari Jaguar executable match his source code files
-- Otherwise, source code and assembly may not match or leads to instabilities
9) The emulator needs to be restarted in case of the following actions occur
-- Key bindings changes
-- BIOS selection changes and without new executable load
10) In the case of a ROM cartridge writing, and with occuring breakpoint, the PC pointer will point at the next instruction and not at the instruction causing the breakpoint
11) Emulator will crash in case of wrong address value provided in the memory browser
12) The RAM access log is limited to the 2MB
13) In various occasions, global variables may be duplicated or without name in the DWARF information
-- It may come from the Vlink linker and/or GCC 7.1.0 or 8.2.0 compilation with -gdwarf-2 option
14) Source code disply only assembled code from vasm with option -dwarf
15) After a new breakpoint set, the breakpoint list window is not refreshed
-- User must perform an operation, such code tracing, to see the breakpoints list update
16) Some ASCII characters may be not displayed correctly
-- Probably depend how the text is displayed, this is related to the Qt/HTML encoding done when reading DWARF file
17) Potential legacy crash when leaving emulator in pause mode for a long period of time
-- Need much investigation

Cosmetic / UX issues
====================
1) The SP (Stack) icon color backgound doesn't look similar with the other ones
2) The SP (Stack) browser size always open at a forced size no matter if the size has been changed
3) Not every features have associated key bindings

Legacy issues/hints
===================
1) Emulator seems to have easter egg(s)
-- The option --yarrr displays a single message and end the application
-- Pressing F8, while in the main window, will create an extra message in the log file
2) The --alpine option force the log file but it can be override if --no-log option is set after the --alpine option

Project information
===================
1) Code based on the Shamus Hammons source code available via Gethub by the 12th September 2017 (2.1.3 Final)
2) Visual Studio 2017 project support for 64 bits
3) libelf 0.8.13 library 64bits for VS 2017
4) libdwarf 20210305 library 64bits for VS 2017
5) Qt 5.12.0 library 64bits for VS 2017
6) Zlib 1.2.11 library 64bits for VS 2017
7) SDL 1.2.15 library 64bits for VS 2017
8) The original make files have been modified to follow the requirements and modifications
9) The 'Rx' word has been added to the emulator name to make distinction with the official version
10) The project is set at https://github.com/djipi/Virtual-Jaguar-Rx
11) GPLv3 file document has been renamed as LICENSE, to fit better the GitHub requirements
-- Text / License terms are the same
14) The x86 configuration has been removed in the VS 2017 project
